- can I make it so that int OR integer is accepted?
- is VAR_TYPE Okay for function def?
- did I do operator right?
- is comment done correctly?
- do we have to use all the alternatives for every rule in our code or just every rule in our program?
- how to add i++?
- need to add a LOT of functionality for class
    - ie. class.fc() (methodCall: PERIOD VARIABLE OPEN_PAREN CLOSE_PAREN)
    - ie. "new" and creating an object
- maybe change function definition to not include return type for the sake of continuity between definitions
- what do you mean by "Also, make sure you edit your text files and source code under a linux/unix system (or at least convert them to only use newline for end of line). " on the forum?
- did he say that a return statement is a unary?
- is my *empty* ok or do I need to change it to EMPTY ?
- is boolean ok?
- do i need to define sum, increment, decrement, product, etc?
- should operators be unary's?
